# Session Log

Append-only record of what each session worked on. Newest entries at the top.

Every session **must** add an entry before closing. The goal is that a future session can read the most recent 2–3 entries and immediately understand the current state of the project.

## 2026-04-21 — Phase 1 Session 1: Scaffold & shell

**Session goal:** Lay the Vite + React + TS-strict foundation with Tailwind tokens, split-home route, PWA scaffold for GH Pages, import-boundary-enforcing ESLint, a working Vitest TDD loop proven end-to-end, and a CI deploy workflow.

**Done:**

- Scaffolded Vite 5 + React 18 + TS 5 strict (Node 22.14, pnpm 10.15). Every runtime and dev dependency pinned in `package.json`.
- Tailwind configured with dark-first HSL-CSS-variable tokens (`gain`, `loss`, `risk`, `neutral`, `accent`, bg/fg/border variants). Global `prefers-reduced-motion` override in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- App shell: `AppProviders` (TanStack Query with sensible defaults), `AppRouter` (React Router v6 `createBrowserRouter` with `basename` tied to `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`), and `SplitHome` route rendering `AnalyticsPanel` + `JournalPanel` empty-state cards. `SplitHome` lives in `src/app/`, not `src/features/home/`, because cross-feature composition cannot live in a feature folder without violating CLAUDE.md §3.7 (see refactor commit `2a05638`).
- ESLint (legacy `.eslintrc.cjs`) with `eslint-plugin-boundaries` encoding CLAUDE.md §4. Added `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` + ADR-0005 so the rule also fires on `@features/*` aliased imports, not just relative ones (the rule was silently half-enforcing without it).
- Prettier configured; tracked docs and one source file reformatted to conform.
- Vitest + RTL + jsdom; setup file in `src/tests/setup.ts`; smoke test at `src/app/SplitHome.test.tsx`.
- First TDD cycle end-to-end: `src/entities/wallet.ts` (branded `WalletAddress`) + `src/domain/wallets/isValidWalletAddress.{ts,test.ts}` (8 tests, 100% coverage; 90% threshold enforced for `src/domain/**`).
- PWA scaffold: inline-SVG favicon, placeholder icons, spa-github-pages 404.html redirect + companion decoder script in `index.html`.
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that installs with `--frozen-lockfile`, runs typecheck + lint + `test:coverage` + build (with `VITE_BASE_PATH=/<repo>/`), then deploys via `actions/deploy-pages@v4`. The 404.html fallback step is guarded to avoid overwriting the real redirect file.
- Updated `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` §§2–3, 5–6, 8–10 with patterns that landed this session.

**Deferred / not done:**

- Playwright and any E2E tests — no user flow to exercise yet; Session 4+.
- shadcn/ui initialization — first real consumer arrives in Session 2 (wallet input).
- Real PWA icons (192/512 PNG + maskable variants) — Session 5 polish.
- The automatic merge of `packageManager@pnpm@9.12.0` (plan) → `pnpm@10.15.0` (local env) was applied without an ADR because 10.x is drop-in compatible for our usage. If it causes friction later, revisit.

**Decisions made:** ADR-0002 (GH Pages deploy), ADR-0003 (pnpm), ADR-0004 (React Router v6 BrowserRouter), ADR-0005 (ESLint legacy config + `eslint-import-resolver-typescript`).

**Gotchas for next session:**

- Production builds must be run with `VITE_BASE_PATH=/<repo-name>/` or Pages asset paths 404. CI sets this from `github.event.repository.name`; locally, set it manually.
- Per ADR-0004, the wallet address belongs in the URL (e.g., `/w/:address`), not in Zustand. Session 2's wallet feature should consume it with `useParams()`.
- Path aliases are duplicated across `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and `vitest.config.ts`. Any new alias must be added to all three or tests, build, or lint will silently miss it. `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` reads from `tsconfig.json` automatically.
- The boundaries rule now fires on both relative and aliased imports. A probe (`src/domain/wallets/_probe.tsx` importing `@features/analytics`) was used during Task 5 to verify and then cleaned up. Repeat the probe pattern when changing boundary rules in the future.
- After the first push to GitHub, enable Pages manually: Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions. Not automatable.
- The `Copy 404.html` step in the CI workflow is guarded (`if [ ! -f dist/404.html ]`) so it does not overwrite the SPA redirect written by `public/404.html`. The original plan text had an unconditional `cp` that would have broken SPA routing in production — left a note in Task 9's prompt about the fix.
- `features/home/` was tried and removed; do not reintroduce it. Composition across features goes in `src/app/`.

**Invariants assumed:**

- Every test added to `src/domain/**` keeps coverage ≥ 90% (threshold in `vitest.config.ts`). Tests for `lib/`, `features/`, etc. are not coverage-enforced (yet).
- `src/styles/globals.css` is the single source of CSS custom properties; components consume them only through Tailwind color classes. Hex/rgb literals in components are a regression.
- The `boundaries` ESLint rule is the authoritative encoder of CLAUDE.md §4. Any relaxation requires an ADR that amends §4 first.
- The commit history tells the story one logical change at a time. Do not squash: the sequence of dbcf2cb → 1ef8f62 → 2a05638 encodes the review response loop that produced the final Task 4 state; future readers need to see it.
